Hereâ€™s how data flows between the **frontend**, **backend**, and **database** in your project, step by step, using an example of submitting and retrieving assignments:

---

### **1. Data Submission Flow (Frontend to Database)**
#### Scenario: A student uploads an assignment.

1. **Frontend Interaction:**
   - The student selects an assignment file and clicks "Submit" on the frontend (e.g., a form on a page in `src/pages` or a component in `src/components`).
   - The frontend uses JavaScript (likely with libraries like `axios` or `fetch`) to send a `POST` request to the backend API endpoint.

   Example Request:
   - **URL:** `/api/student/submit`
   - **Method:** `POST`
   - **Body:** JSON or multipart/form-data containing:
     ```json
     {
         "assignmentId": "12345",
         "file": "<uploaded-file>"
     }
     ```

2. **Backend API Route:**
   - The request is routed to the appropriate backend API route in `studentRoutes.js`:
     ```javascript
     router.post('/submit', studentController.submitAssignment);
     ```

3. **Controller Logic:**
   - The `studentController.js` processes the request. It:
     - Extracts the `assignmentId` and file from the request.
     - Validates the data (e.g., checks if the file and ID are valid).
     - Saves the file to the `uploads/` directory.

4. **Database Interaction:**
   - The backend uses the `Submission.js` model to save a record of the submission in the database.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const submission = new Submission({
         studentId: req.user.id, // From the authenticated token
         assignmentId: req.body.assignmentId,
         filePath: filePath, // Path to the uploaded file
         submittedAt: new Date(),
     });
     await submission.save();
     ```

5. **Response to Frontend:**
   - The backend responds with a success message, which the frontend uses to notify the student.
   - Example Response:
     ```json
     {
         "message": "Assignment submitted successfully",
         "submissionId": "67890"
     }
     ```

### **2. Data Retrieval Flow (Database to Frontend)**
#### Scenario: A teacher retrieves all submissions for an assignment.

1. **Frontend Request:**
   - The teacher navigates to a page showing all submissions for an assignment. The frontend sends a `GET` request to fetch the data.
   - Example Request:
     - **URL:** `/api/teacher/submissions?assignmentId=12345`
     - **Method:** `GET`

2. **Backend API Route:**
   - The request is routed to the appropriate backend API route in `teacherRoutes.js`:
     ```javascript
     router.get('/submissions', teacherController.getSubmissions);
     ```

3. **Controller Logic:**
   - The `teacherController.js` processes the request. It:
     - Extracts the `assignmentId` from the query parameters.
     - Queries the `Submission.js` model for all submissions linked to that assignment.

   Example Query:
   ```javascript
   const submissions = await Submission.find({ assignmentId: req.query.assignmentId })
       .populate('studentId') // Fetch related student details
       .exec();
   ```

4. **Database Interaction:**
   - The `Submission.js` model interacts with the database to retrieve matching records. 
   - The `.populate()` method fetches related `User.js` (student) data, such as name or email, for each submission.

5. **Response to Frontend:**
   - The backend sends the data back as a JSON response.
   - Example Response:
     ```json
     [
         {
             "submissionId": "67890",
             "student": {
                 "id": "98765",
                 "name": "John Doe",
                 "email": "john@example.com"
             },
             "filePath": "/uploads/assignment1.docx",
             "submittedAt": "2024-11-25T12:00:00Z"
         },
         {
             "submissionId": "67891",
             "student": {
                 "id": "87654",
                 "name": "Jane Smith",
                 "email": "jane@example.com"
             },
             "filePath": "/uploads/assignment2.docx",
             "submittedAt": "2024-11-25T12:30:00Z"
         }
     ]
     ```

6. **Frontend Display:**
   - The frontend receives the data and dynamically updates the UI to show a table or list of submissions, including file links and student details.

### **Summary of Data Flow**

#### **1. Frontend to Backend**
- Frontend sends a request to the backend API using `axios`/`fetch`.
- Backend receives, validates, and processes the request.

#### **2. Backend to Database**
- Backend queries or updates the database using models (`User.js`, `Assignment.js`, `Submission.js`) and an ORM like Mongoose.

#### **3. Database to Backend**
- Database returns the requested data or acknowledges updates (e.g., saving new records).
- Backend processes and formats the data for the frontend.

#### **4. Backend to Frontend**
- Backend sends the final response (JSON) to the frontend.
- Frontend updates the UI based on the response (e.g., success messages, rendered data).
