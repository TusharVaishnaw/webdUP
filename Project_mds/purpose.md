Your project has a structured folder system. Below is an explanation of the purpose of each folder and key files based on the directory structure:

---

### **Root Structure**
- **`assignment-backend`**: This folder contains all backend logic, such as APIs, middleware, and database interactions.
- **`assignment-frontend`**: This folder contains all frontend logic, including user interfaces, styles, and components.

---

### **Backend Structure**
- **`controllers/`**: 
  - Contains logic for handling specific tasks or features (e.g., managing users, authentication, assignments).
  - Example files: 
    - `adminController.js`: Handles admin-related functionality.
    - `authController.js`: Manages user login/logout and authentication.
    - `studentController.js`: Handles operations specific to students.
    - `teacherController.js`: Deals with teacher-related operations.

- **`middleware/`**:
  - Contains reusable functions for processing requests before they reach the main logic (e.g., authentication checks).
  - Example file: 
    - `authMiddleware.js`: Ensures users are authenticated.

- **`models/`**:
  - Represents database tables or entities.
  - Example files: 
    - `User.js`: Defines the user schema for the database.
    - `Assignment.js`: Handles the assignment schema.
    - `Submission.js`: Defines submission data for assignments.

- **`routes/`**:
  - Defines API endpoints for the backend.
  - Example files:
    - `authRoutes.js`: Routes for login, logout, and authentication.
    - `adminRoutes.js`: API endpoints for admin features.
    - `studentRoutes.js`: API endpoints specific to students.
    - `teacherRoutes.js`: API endpoints for teachers.

- **`uploads/`**:
  - Stores uploaded files, such as assignments or submissions.

- **Other Backend Files**:
  - `.env`: Stores environment-specific variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
  - `server.js`: The main file that initializes and starts the backend server.
  - `package.json`: Contains dependencies and scripts for the backend.

---

### **Frontend Structure**
- **`public/`**:
  - Stores static assets (e.g., HTML, manifest files).
  - Example files:
    - `index.html`: The entry point for the web application.
    - `manifest.json`: Configuration file for Progressive Web Apps (PWA).
    - `robots.txt`: Provides instructions for web crawlers.

- **`src/`**:
  - Contains the application's core code.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, forms).
  - **`pages/`**: Pages that make up the application (e.g., login page, dashboard).
  - Example file:
    - `index.css`: Styles for the entire application.

- **Other Frontend Files**:
  - `package.json`: Contains dependencies and scripts for the frontend.

This structure helps separate backend and frontend concerns, making the application modular and easier to manage. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific file or folder!
